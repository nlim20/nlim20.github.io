        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 1st year graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University seeking internships for the summer of 2024.
           I take pride in my technical ability as well as my capacity for creativity. I use both to build things that bring people utility and joy.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Tesla</h3>
        <img src="Tesla_logo.png" width="30" height="30" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
        <p> Throughout my 2 internships with Tesla's hardware test org, I was able to assume the responsibilities of a full-time 
            test engineer and take end-to-end ownership of the mechanical, electrical, and control systems design
            a number of critical component, system, and vehicle-level tests. Tests and 
            fixtures I designed during these internships cost anywhere from $500 to $25,000 to produce and provided countless meaningful 
            insights that were used to improve vehicle reliability, safety, and quality. I've noted my favorite projects below. <br />

        <h3>EcoCAR UC Davis</h3>
        <img src="horiz_transparent.png" width="100" height="30" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
        <p>The EcoCAR EV challenge is a student competition in which teams compete to build the best next generation electric vehicle.
           As the system design and integration lead for UC Davis' team, I completed several notable individual projects in addition to my
           leadership responsibilities.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h5>1. 4-Bar Window Cycler (Tesla)</h5>
        Wrote and utilized linkage synthesis tools in C to generate a 4-bar geometry capable of cycling a manual side window with 
        an irregular handle sweep. Final design was able to load the system in a human-representative manner while only requiring 1 actuator and 
        relatively simple controls. <br />

        <h5>2. Vertical Strength Testing Gantry (Tesla)</h5>
        Designed and implemented a vertical gantry system capable of applying high loads to every +z surface on a vehicle. Structural design was 
        driven by seismic loads and deflection criteria at the end effector. 
        <br />

        <h5>3. Cable Durability Test Rig (Tesla)</h5>
        Designed and implemented a test rig and control system capable of durability testing 12 separate cables independently while continuously
        collecting performance data and detecting failures. 
        <br />

        <h5>4. Custom Cadillac LYRIQ Subframe and Powertrain Mounting (EcoCAR)</h5>
        Designed and planned the integration of a custom chassis structure and mounting/packaging strategy for an energy efficient
        battery electric powertrain in a Cadillac LYRIQ. Involved managing and digesting top-level vehicle CAD,
        reverse engineering of physical vehicles through 3D scanning,
        and detailed structural analysis to ensure added structures met competition designated strength and stiffness requirements.<br />

        <h5>5. Functional Small-Scale Prototype of Automotive Thermal Management System (EcoCAR)</h5>
        Designed and built a functioning scale model of a thermal management system for a Cadillac LYRIQ. A heating element 
        was used to simulate drive unit heat generation which was rejected by a pump-radiator-fan system controlled via
        Arduino.<br />
