        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford seeking internships for the summer of 2024.
           I take pride in my technical ability as well as my capacity for creativity. I use both to build things that bring people utility and joy.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Tesla â€” Hardware Test Engineering</h3>
        <p> Throughout my 2 internships with Tesla's test org, I was able to assume the responsibilities of a full- 
            time test engineer and take end-to-end ownership of the mechanical, electrical, and control systems design
            a number of critical component, system, and vehicle-level tests. Tests and 
            fixtures I designed during these internships cost anywhere from $500 to $25,000 to produce and provided countless meaningful 
            insights that were used to improve vehicle reliability, safety, and quality. <br />

        <h4>Projects</h4>
        <b>1. 4-Bar Window Cycler (2022)</b>:
        Wrote and utilized linkage synthesis tools in C to generate a 4-bar geometry capable of cycling a manual side window with 
        an irregular handle sweep. I then used my kinematic tool to create a final design loaded the system in a human-representative manner while only requiring 1 actuator and 
        relatively simple controls. <br /><br />

        <b>2. Vertical Strength Testing Gantry (2023)</b>:
        Designed and implemented a vertical gantry system capable of applying high loads to every +z surface on a vehicle. Structural design was 
        driven by seismic loads and deflection criteria at the end effector. 
        <br /><br />

        <b>3. Cable Durability Test Rig (2022)</b>:
        Designed and implemented a test rig and control system capable of durability testing 12 separate cables independently while continuously
        collecting performance data and detecting failures.
